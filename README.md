`ADNIMetabo` provides access to a curated collection of data-sets from
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). This package is
intended to facilitate research on Alzheimer’s Disease by providing
structured and easy-to-use demographic, clinical, imaging, biomarker,
and cognitive data. Metabolomics data will be included in a future
release.

## Datasets accessible now

- **Demographic data**: Includes participant information such as age,
  sex, education, ethnicity, and marital status.
- **Baseline clinical data**: Baseline clinical assessments including
  diagnosis, CDR-SB, ADAS scores, MMSE, and RAVLT scores.
- **Follow-Up clinical data**: Longitudinal clinical assessments over
  follow-up visits.
- **Biomarker data**: Includes CSF biomarker levels (ABETA, TAU, PTAU),
  FDG-PET, PIB, and AV45 imaging markers.
- **Imaging data**: MRI-related measurements such as MRI field strength,
  FreeSurfer version, and various brain region volumes.
- **Cognitive composite scores**: Composite scores like mPACCdigit and
  mPACCtrailsB for assessing cognitive performance.
- **ECog scores**: Everyday Cognition (ECog) scores from both
  participants and their study partners.
- **Metabolomic data**: \[will be available soon\]. To be made available
  in an upcoming release.

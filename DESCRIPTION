Description: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) provide 
    a list of omics, among them there is metabolomics data. We collected 
    those data and curated them with closer look, for helping researchers 
    and scientists to exploite and navigate easily into the ADNI metabolomic
    datasets. It is possible to access to various datasets from the ADNI, 
    including demographic, clinical, biomarker, imaging, and cognitive 
    composite data.
